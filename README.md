# Python-Spreadsheet-Software
If you want to make your own spreadsheet app like excel, this is a great template for you to start off with!


## Usage

1. Click [here](https://github.com/VismayaAtreya/Python3-Spreadsheet-Software/archive/master.zip) to clone the repository. Extract all the contents into one folder.

2. Open ['Slideshow Software.py'](https://github.com/VismayaAtreya/Python3-Slideshow-Software/blob/master/Slideshow%20Software.py) and not [Without Pillow.py](https://github.com/VismayaAtreya/Python3-Slideshow-Software/blob/master/Without%20Pillow.py) in [IDLE](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html)

3. Click on <b>Run -> Run Module</b> and wait for a tkinter window to pop up.

<b>Alternatively, you can also try executing `python3` or `python` followed by your file's location like this, in Terminal or Command Prompt</b>

```
python3 /Users/Me/Documents/Python3-Spreadsheet-Software-master/Spreadsheet Software.py
```

4. From the window, select your dimensions.
